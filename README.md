After finishing the study of unsupervised learning, this mini project had a lot of techniques I learned.
1. Firstly, the code starts by removing the null values and the outliers from the data so they don't affect
the results
2. Secondly, scaling the data to ensure that every feature has a mean of '0' and  a standard deviation of '1'.
3. Then, use a dimensionality technique called 'PCA' to extract the best principle components.
4. And now the most important part is applying the "KMeans" model to make clustering.
5. Finally, calculate the score and plot the data after clustering.
